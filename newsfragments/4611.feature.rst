Added support for the environment variable
``SETUPTOOLS_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PYPROJECT_VALIDATION=true``, allowing users to bypass
the validation of ``pyproject.toml``.
This option should be used only as a last resort when resolving dependency
issues, as it may lead to improper functioning.
Users who enable this setting are responsible for ensuring that ``pyproject.toml``
complies with setuptools requirements.
